We have added the data into a non-relational database that can parse and give us greater querying capabilities. We have created a group of 1000, of the closest NEAs scaled down to a 1:275,000km, starting from the closest and moving to the furthest NEA. Also with administrative capability to modify all of the data inserted and exported out of the database.</p>
